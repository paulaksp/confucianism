            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">CONFUCIAN ETHICS</h3>
            <p class = "lead">Confucianism is an ethical and philosophical framework based on the teachings of the ancient Chinese politician, teacher, and philosopher <a href = "http://www.egs.edu/library/confucius/biography/"> Confucius </a> (551-479 BCE). Confucius lived during a time of moral decline; the ancient system of rule was deteriorating into confusion and corruption. Confucius recognized the need to redefine societal values and ethics. Born out of his teachings and writings is the Confucian ethical framework. Confucius’ writings are preserved in <a href = "http://www.sacred-texts.com/cfu/#fivecla">The Five Classics </a>  and <a href = "http://classics.mit.edu/Confucius/analects.html">The Analects. </a> </p>

            <p class="lead">When categorized under the Western philosophical lens, Confucianism can be considered a form of <a href = "http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/"> virtue ethics </a>, where the focus is not on rules that govern one’s actions or the consequences actions may cause, but rather on the way one should lead his or her life and the type of person one should become. Confucianism rests on “the notion that human nature can be improved and perfected through a systematic approach to self-cultivation,” and that every person, regardless of their birthright or socioeconomic status, can practice this self-cultivation to become the best possible version of his or herself. <a href = "http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html"> Confucian </a> ethics are governed under the Five Constants, which have an overarching theme of self-cultivation.</p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">FIVE CONSTANTS</h3>
            <p class="lead">At the core of Confucianism lies the constant Ren, or humaneness, compassion, and loving others. Confucius recognizes that, at their core, humans are social creatures, and thus human relations are of the utmost importance. Ren is seen as the source of all virtues, and is emphasized in our interactions with other human beings. Ren is manifested in Confucius’ Golden Rule: “What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.” Actions performed with ren in mind are meaningful, and thus ren is seen as the ultimate guide for all human action. Ren is the inner manifestation of character cultivation.</p>

            <h4>Li</h4>
            <p class="lead">Li, or proper rite, goes hand-in-hand with ren. To practice li is to respect and properly practice the existing rules of society. Confucius states that existing human ceremonies, rituals, and social norms exist because they are the result of generations of human wisdom. To practice li in one’s interactions with both humans and material objects is to  respect both one’s elders as well as one’s peers in society. Any such interaction should be performed with ren. In learning ren and li together, one learns the limits of individuality and learns how to reconcile his or her needs and desires with those of society. Linked with this idea of Li is the importance of relationships. Confucius states that human relationships come before all else. The everyday actions one performs in one’s relationships with other human beings should be done with meaning, because they are the core of what we have in life. In Confucianism, there are Five Relationships that embody the ways in which we interact with other humans. Three of the five relationships are found within the family, showing that the basic social unit in Confucianism is the family unit. Confucius argues that everyone has some variant of each of these relationships, and everyone should act according to their role in the relationship.</p>
            <ul class="lead lead-list">
            <li>Father and child (loving/reverential)</li>
            <li>Elder and younger siblings (gentle/respectful)</li>
            <li>husband and wife (good / listening) </li>
            <li>older and younger friend (considerate/ deferential) </li>
            <li>ruler and subject (benevolent / loyal)</li>
            </ul> 

            <p class="lead">While each relationship is unique and has its own specificities and nuances, all people should treat others with love, respect, and consideration -- above all, ren. Confucius stresses the importance of filial piety, or respect for elders. This respect is shown in li, both by respecting the deceased by honoring their rituals and ceremonies, as well as by respecting living elders in these Five Relationships. Juniors have an obligation to revere and respect their elders. Conversely, elders have an obligation to show benevolence and compassion to their juniors. 
            </p>

            <h4>Yi</h4>
            <p class="lead">Yi, or righteousness, embodies the ideas of rightness of action. In the spirit of virtue ethics, Confucius argues that one should have an inherent sense and disposition to do good and to perform actions simply because they are right, regardless of intention or consequence. When a person acts in the spirit of yi, he is acting with ren, acting with love for humanity when he chooses the right actions. This idea of yi stands in stark contrast with the ideas of some Western viewpoints we’ve discussed in class. In utilitarianism, actions are performed to optimize consequences, while in Confucianism, the focus is on the action itself, and not the consequences. We will expand on this contrast when we begin our discussion of computer ethics.</p>

            <h4>Zhi</h4>
            <p class="lead">Zhi, or knowledge, encompases the ideas of moral knowledge, as well as practical and academic knowledge. Confucius places a heavy emphasis on the importance of lifelong education; he believes that the only true understanding of any subject comes from long and careful study. He stresses the importance of finding teachers who have knowledge of and from those who came before them to guide you along your educational journey. To Confucius, the most important subjects are moral knowledge and the “Six Arts” of ritual, music, archery, chariot-riding, calligraphy, and computation. He states <quote>"He who learns but does not think is lost. He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger,"" </quote> expressing a belief that natural understanding and intuition alone  never suffices in a person’s education. <quote>"At fifteen, I set my heart on learning. At thirty, I was firmly established. At forty, I had no more doubts. At fifty, I knew the will of heaven. At sixty, I was ready to listen to it. At seventy, I could follow my heart’s desire without transgressing what was right" Analects, 2:4 </quote> As a result, the Confucian view of society is one based on educational meritocracy. </p>

            <h4>Xin</h4>
            <p class="lead">The final Confucian constant is Xin, or integrity. Xin is where cognitive and affective activities are, and can be interpreted as "faithfulness." Xin allows one to form both long- and short-term goals in life, and in combination with Zhi, and Ren, allows one to deviate from the established li when one determines that the rituals are outdated or incorrect and need to be changed. </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">INDIVIDUAL</h3>
            <p class="lead">The Confucian ideal person, or Junzi, is a scholar and sage who embodies the greatest human potential by cultivating his own morals, practicing altruism and benevolence to others, and exhibiting loyalty and piety. He is comfortable with his place in the world and demands nothing of other people while still being at their disposal for any help they may need. He exhibits the essence of all five constants. Of course, very few people actually reach this state, but Confucians strive to become this by following the teachings of Confucius. At the core of Confucianism is the idea that all human beings are perfectible if they practice self-cultivation and ritual. </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">GOVERNMENT</h3>
            <p class="lead">Regarding government, the Confucian idea is that a <quote> “good government consists in the ruler being a rule, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son.” </quote> In sum, governing officials should practice li and ren, promoting existing social rituals and norms while acting in the best interests of their subjects. This is also seen in the ruler-subject part of the Five Relationships. 
            <quote> “If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord” </quote> In ideal Confucian government, people ascend ranks not by birthright or bribery, but by demonstrated knowledge and education. In the Confucian state, rulers lead by example, showing their subjects what it really is to lead a good, moral life. When conflicts arise, as they inevitably will, Confucian rulers mediate them with  moral example, rather than abstract rules that determine right, wrong, and punishment. Confucius believes in a merit bureaucracy where rulers are selected for their moral qualities, and where rulers treat their subjects with love and respect. However, this ideal Confucian state has <a href = "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/03/4-confucius-china-internet-schuman"> not always translated into real-world Confucian governments </a>, but we will examine this further in our discussion of the government and computer ethics.</p>

We work with the technology industry to create a culture that is more appealing to women, and we work with young women across the globe to dismantle harmful perceptions that they cannot succeed in the technology industry. Our outreach includes an annual fellowship for high school students, an ambassador program for college students, and the creation of online videos and campaigns. We are rebranding technology to be less about the stereotypes, and more about the problem-solving, the building, and the impact. By tackling the source of these stereotypes, we hope to create a field where women feel included, respected, and valued. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit run by Stanford undergraduate students. </p>
