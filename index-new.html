          The philosophical and ethical frameworks we’ve discussed in CS181 mostly all part of the Western tradition. However, the issues in computer ethics are not restricted to the West– as we enter an age where information technology connects people across the world, the ethical dilemmas and quandaries we will face will be of a global perspective. Thus, it is important to consider computer ethics under the lens of non-Western philosophical traditions. In our project, we will consider the teachings of Confucius, an ancient Chinese philosopher who established the Confucian ethical framework. We will then examine issues in computer ethics through this Confucian ethical lens. We’ve grouped our ethics discussion into three broad categories: 
          <ul class="lead lead-list">
          <li>1. Issues regarding the individual</li>
          <li>2. Issues regarding the government </li>
          <li>3. Issues regarding the economy. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="lead">We will compare and contrast the Confucian view of these ethical issues with Western viewpoints on the same issues, focusing on Western ethical frameworks we discussed in class. We will also provide policy suggestions derived from this Confucian perspective.</p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">CONFUCIAN ETHICS</h3>

            <p class = "lead">Confucianism is an ethical and philosophical framework based on the teachings of the ancient Chinese politician, teacher, and philosopher <a href = "http://www.egs.edu/library/confucius/biography/" target = "_blank"> Confucius </a> (551-479 BCE). Confucius lived during a time of moral decline; the ancient system of rule was deteriorating into confusion and corruption. Confucius recognized the need to redefine societal values and ethics. Born out of his teachings and writings is the Confucian ethical framework. Confucius’ writings are preserved in <a href = "http://www.sacred-texts.com/cfu/#fivecla" target = "_blank">The Five Classics </a>  and <a href = "http://classics.mit.edu/Confucius/analects.html" target = "_blank">The Analects. </a> </p>

            <p class="lead">When categorized under the Western philosophical lens, Confucianism can be considered a form of <a href = "http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/"> virtue ethics </a>, where the focus is not on rules that govern one’s actions or the consequences actions may cause, but rather on the way one should lead his or her life and the type of person one should become. Confucianism rests on “the notion that human nature can be improved and perfected through a systematic approach to self-cultivation,” and that every person, regardless of their birthright or socioeconomic status, can practice this self-cultivation to become the best possible version of his or herself. <a href = "http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/main.html" target = "_blank"> Confucian </a> ethics are governed under the Five Constants, which have an overarching theme of self-cultivation.</p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">FIVE CONSTANTS</h3>
            <h4>Ren</h4>
            <p class="lead">At the core of Confucianism lies the constant <i>Ren</i>, or humaneness, compassion, and loving others. Confucius recognizes that, at their core, humans are social creatures, and thus human relations are of the utmost importance. Ren is seen as the source of all virtues, and is emphasized in our interactions with other human beings. <i>Ren</i> is manifested in Confucius’ Golden Rule: </p>
            <blockquote>
             “What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.” 
             <footer> Confucius </footer>
           </blockquote>
           <p class = "lead"> Actions performed with <i>ren</i> in mind are meaningful, and thus ren is seen as the ultimate guide for all human action. <i>Ren</i> is the inner manifestation of character cultivation.</p>

            <h4>Li</h4>
            <p class="lead"><i>Li</i>, or proper rite, goes hand-in-hand with ren. To practice <i>li</i> is to respect and properly practice the existing rules of society. Confucius states that existing human ceremonies, rituals, and social norms exist because they are the result of generations of human wisdom. To practice <i>li</i> in one’s interactions with both humans and material objects is to  respect both one’s elders as well as one’s peers in society. Any such interaction should be performed with <i>ren</i>. In learning <i>ren</i> and <i>li</i> together, one learns the limits of individuality and learns how to reconcile his or her needs and desires with those of society. Linked with this idea of <i>li</i> is the importance of relationships. Confucius states that human relationships come before all else. The everyday actions one performs in one’s relationships with other human beings should be done with meaning, because they are the core of what we have in life. In Confucianism, there are Five Relationships that embody the ways in which we interact with other humans. Three of the five relationships are found within the family, showing that the basic social unit in Confucianism is the family unit. Confucius argues that everyone has some variant of each of these relationships, and everyone should act according to their role in the relationship.</p>

            <ul class="lead lead-list">
            <li>Father and child (loving/reverential)</li>
            <li>Elder and younger siblings (gentle/respectful)</li>
            <li>husband and wife (good / listening) </li>
            <li>older and younger friend (considerate/ deferential) </li>
            <li>ruler and subject (benevolent / loyal)</li>
            </ul> 

            <p class="lead">While each relationship is unique and has its own specificities and nuances, all people should treat others with love, respect, and consideration -- above all, <i>ren</i>. Confucius stresses the importance of filial piety, or respect for elders. This respect is shown in <i>li</i>, both by respecting the deceased by honoring their rituals and ceremonies, as well as by respecting living elders in these Five Relationships. Juniors have an obligation to revere and respect their elders. Conversely, elders have an obligation to show benevolence and compassion to their juniors. 
            </p>

            <h4>Yi</h4>
            <p class="lead"><i>Yi</i>, or righteousness, embodies the ideas of rightness of action. In the spirit of virtue ethics, Confucius argues that one should have an inherent sense and disposition to do good and to perform actions simply because they are right, regardless of intention or consequence. When a person acts in the spirit of <i>yi</i>, he is acting with <i>ren</i>, acting with love for humanity when he chooses the right actions. This idea of <i>yi</i> stands in stark contrast with the ideas of some Western viewpoints we’ve discussed in class. In utilitarianism, actions are performed to optimize consequences, while in Confucianism, the focus is on the action itself, and not the consequences. We will expand on this contrast when we begin our discussion of computer ethics.</p>

            <h4>Zhi</h4>
            <p class="lead"><i>Zhi</i>, or knowledge, encompases the ideas of moral knowledge, as well as practical and academic knowledge. Confucius places a heavy emphasis on the importance of lifelong education; he believes that the only true understanding of any subject comes from long and careful study. He stresses the importance of finding teachers who have knowledge of and from those who came before them to guide you along your educational journey. To Confucius, the most important subjects are moral knowledge and the “Six Arts” of ritual, music, archery, chariot-riding, calligraphy, and computation. He states, "He who learns but does not think is lost. He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger," expressing a belief that natural understanding and intuition alone  never suffices in a person’s education. Thus, Confucianism stresses the importance of a social meritocracy. </p>

            <blockquote>"At fifteen, I set my heart on learning. At thirty, I was firmly established. At forty, I had no more doubts. At fifty, I knew the will of heaven. At sixty, I was ready to listen to it. At seventy, I could follow my heart’s desire without transgressing what was right" 
              <footer> Confucius, Analects, 2:4 </footer>
            </blockquote> 

            <br>

            <h4><i>Xin</i></h4>
            <p class="lead">The final Confucian constant is <i>Xin</i>, or integrity. <i>Xin</i> is where cognitive and affective activities are, and can be interpreted as "faithfulness." <i>Xin</i> allows one to form both long- and short-term goals in life, and in combination with <i>zhi</i>, and <i>ren</i>, allows one to deviate from the established <i>li</i> when one determines that the rituals are outdated or incorrect and need to be changed. </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">INDIVIDUAL</h3>
            <p class="lead">The Confucian ideal person, or <i>Junzi</i>, is a scholar and sage who embodies the greatest human potential by cultivating his own morals, practicing altruism and benevolence to others, and exhibiting loyalty and piety. He is comfortable with his place in the world and demands nothing of other people while still being at their disposal for any help they may need. He exhibits the essence of all five constants. Of course, very few people actually reach this state, but Confucians strive to become this by following the teachings of Confucius. At the core of Confucianism is the idea that all human beings are perfectible if they practice self-cultivation and ritual. </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY</h3>
            <p class="lead">Regarding government, the Confucian idea is that a <quote> “good government consists in the ruler being a rule, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son.” </quote> In sum, governing officials should practice <i>li</i> and <i>ren</i>, promoting existing social rituals and norms while acting in the best interests of their subjects. This is also seen in the ruler-subject part of the Five Relationships. </p>
            <blockquote> “If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord” 
              <footer> Confucius </footer> </blockquote> 
            <p class = "lead">In ideal Confucian government, people ascend ranks not by birthright or bribery, but by demonstrated knowledge and education. In the Confucian state, rulers lead by example, showing their subjects what it really is to lead a good, moral life. When conflicts arise, as they inevitably will, Confucian rulers mediate them with  moral example, rather than abstract rules that determine right, wrong, and punishment. Confucius believes in a merit bureaucracy where rulers are selected for their moral qualities, and where rulers treat their subjects with love and respect. However, this ideal Confucian state has <a href = "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/03/4-confucius-china-internet-schuman" target = "_blank"> not always translated into real-world Confucian governments </a>, but we will examine this further in our discussion of the government and computer ethics.</p>

            <h2 class = "featurette-heading purple-h2">Perspectives on the Individual</h2>

            <h3 class="purple">THE INDIVIDUAL</h3>
            <p class="lead">TThe Western and Confucian perspective on individuality differs drastically in both definition and scope. The Western view of personhood is an individual in possession of certain characteristics and conceived as independent, rational and self-determining. The Confucian view of personhood goes beyond this solitary definition to encompass social, cultural and historical links and meaning: the Confucian individual is <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-011-0021-z/fulltext.html%3E" target="_blank">relational, developmental, and virtue based (Wong)</a>. In Confucian thought, importance is placed on a person’s self-cultivation, also known as “creative dynamics,” where the virtues of Ren (humanness), Yi (justice), Zhi (knowledge) and Xin (integrity) are developed. This virtuous person must then strive to establish harmonious familial and social relationships and act according to Li (rites), proper and virtue based conduct within society. This harmonious society that Confucius wanted to create has a distinct Utilitarian feel to it, benefited the society as a whole, rather than a single person. This Confucian perspective on the individual casts an alternative and distinctive ethical view on the issues of privacy, freedom of speech, intellectual property and the hacker ethic as raised by the information technology age.</p>

            <br>
            <h3 class="purple">PRIVACY</h3>
            <p class="lead">The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/alan-f-westin-scholar-who-defined-right-to-privacy-dies-at-83.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Western concept of privacy in the computer age</a> can be defined as “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others,” and the restriction on the access of other people and government to an individual’s personal information (Westin). In contrast, the Confucian ethic does not separate the private and public sphere so clearly. Although in the pursuit of self-cultivation, there is room for personal privacy and intimacy, the Confucian goal is to rise beyond the private sphere and achieve a greater union with an ordered society. Therefore there is less of an emphasis on the rights of private information and autonomy since one’s personhood is determined within a web of relationships and one’s conduct in private life will ultimately be carried into public life. In Confucian ethics, there is little value placed on the unique sense of self that underlie the core of Western theory of privacy (Whitman).</p>

            <p class="lead">Confucianism is concerned with the role of government as a moral influence on personal behavior and thus the idea that privacy defined as <a href="http://repository.law.umich.edu/book_chapters/21/" target="_blank">freedom from observation and surveillance</a> is completely alien (Whitman). The Confucian view can accept and even advocate the pervasive and all-encompassing social surveillance, in the quest for moral education for the individual. For example, whereas a Western perspective abhors the mass collection of personal data by the NSA as revealed by Snowden as an invasion of personal privacy, Confucians could justify the action by arguing that ensuring individuals a moral education and societal security is of greater primary importance than personal privacy.</p>

            <p class="lead"><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3naMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=the+confucian+conception+of+harmony+by+yu&source=bl&ots=8Zriwu-9Sr&sig=fJO5vr_j9jzRUsufCwZGyw1SIrg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=i9NwVYOuCIjHogThi4CwAg&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20confucian%20conception%20of%20harmony%20by%20yu&f=false" target="_blank"> The Confucian concept of harmonization</a> is defined as discourse that is neither “complete agreement” nor “unprincipled compromise,” and requires both “the balancing of one thing versus another one” and “the mutual complementation of acceptance and rejection” (Yu, 2010). The many current moral conundrums pertaining to privacy such as the debate between the right to privacy versus the security of citizens and the moral of employer tracking are very much within the scope of Confucian ethics. </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="purple">FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h3>
            <p class="lead"><a href="http://www.humanrights.cn/zt/magazine/200402004827111009.htm" target="_blank">Confucius said,</a> “A wise man does not promote a person for what he says, neither does he undervalue what is said because of the person who says it” (Kovarik). According to this quote, Confucianism protects freedom of speech, allowing for the independent expression of opinion whether it is right or wrong. However, free speech must be articulated in a reasonable and civilized way so as not to destroy the Confucian concept of harmony, since Confucian society functions through participation and not through conflicting claims to rights. Therefore a Confucius perspective of current dilemmas as to whether code, online publication of bomb making methods and recruitment of terrorists, cyber-bullying and sexually explicit material are part of free speech, may lean more toward the evaluation of impact on society rather than the Western inalienable right of freedom of expression.</p>

            <br>
            <h3 class="purple">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
            <p class="lead">The Confucian concept that individuals transform themselves and build moral character through self-cultivation is built on their ability to learn from society and from the past. Since intellectual property rights allow the monopolization of information, some argue there is a contradiction between intellectual property and Confucian thought. (Yu, 2014) Others would goes as far as to blame Confucianism for causing the enormous <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2506384" target="_blank">piracy and counterfeiting problem </a>in China and other parts of Asia and for blocking intellectual property reforms (Yu, 2014). However, a Confucian ethical approach may provide insights into some of the current difficult intellectual property problems. For example, the Confucian’s focus on harmony and social responsibility may lead to a better balance between proprietary interests and public access needs, to a more equitable resolution of disputes between intellectual property owners and trademark trolls and to reducing disputes between developed and developing countries in the transfer of technology. Furthermore, a Confucian perspective may shed light on how to approach the increasing demand for open source information in both computer software and hardware and the access to knowledge movement.</p>

            <br>
            <h3 class="purple">HACKER ETHIC</h3>
            <p class="lead">The “hacker ethic” is a moral philosophy coined by Steven Levy in his 1984 book, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/729" target="_blank">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a> (Levy). Hackers at MIT in 1950s and 1960s and subsequent hacking generations, many of whom drove the rapid expansion of the computer hardware and software industry over the past half-century, espoused it. The tenets of the hacker ethic (strongly associated with “doing things right,” much like the ideas of deontology), including sharing, openness, decentralization and world improvement falls very closely in line with the Confucian idea of “creative dynamics” (Wong) In creative dynamics, one does not simply agree, but builds on ideas constructively and openly and engages in transformations and continuous self-cultivation for the betterment of society. This idea complements perfectly the Western hacker ethic, which promotes the freedom to tinker and gain knowledge, without the constraints of money, censorship or government. </p>

            <p class="lead">Confucius and Plato both viewed an ideal state as one in which a wise and virtuous ruler would administer justice and ensure the common good. However, Confucius also believed that the people are an intelligent and critical check against abuses in government. It can be argued that the hackers are the people themselves that can help prevent the wrong tendencies of government. Within the confines of Confucianism, there appears to be room for so called hackers such as the Snowdens and Assanges, who rightly or wrongly, release information to the public with the intent of avoiding centralized control and exposing government tyranny.</p>

            <h3 class="purple">CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p class="lead">Western ethical theories tend to focus on norms and morals to regulate what is right and just, while the Confucian approach to ethics alternatively is geared towards acquiring know-how, learning and practicing harmonization, understanding practices that are conducive or detrimental to one’s roles in society. Thus the values of privacy, free speech, and intellectual property right can be viewed from these alternative and distinctive lens. The values of Confucian “creative dynamics,” however, is similar to the Western hacker ethic in that it endeavors to freely and openly learns and utilize technology for the betterment of society.</p>

            <blockquote>
             How and to what extent, if any should ethics for states be different from ethics for individuals? What is the Confucian ethics for government and state?
            </blockquote>

             <h3 class="purple">ROLE OF GOVERNMENT</h3>
             <p class="lead"> Confucianism placed emphasis on <i>jen</i> -- the idea of love, benevolence and humanism. He applies this constant as a guiding principle for states as well as individuals. As Confucius argued in <i>Analects</i>, government should rule and decide for the state as guided by <i>jen</i>. Because of this guiding principle, civility within the Confucian context refers to the eventual achievement of social consensus. The government could lead the state towards that achievement with its firm belief in the upholding of strict moral standards within the state.</p>


            <p class="lead">According to Confucius, the government should benefit not only the representatives and the leader but also all the people and citizens of the state. This bottom-up approach of the government leads to the Confucius ideal of proper governnance. To Confucius, <a href="http://gjis.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/gjis/article/viewFile/35207/31926" target="_blank">proper governance</a> is derived from duty and social harmony within the individual, family and local community.</p>

            <p class="lead">The inherently local feature of the Confucian government regards the ruler as responsible to teach its citizens to learn moral principles in the local communities. Essentially, the ruler's function is to educate and transform its citizens to become moral beings, and the state's function is as the moral guardian of the people.</p>

            <blockquote>
             Lead the people with governmental measures and regulate them with laws and punishment, and they will avoid wrongdoing but will have no sense of honor and shame. Lead them with virtue and regulate them by the rules of propriety, and they will have a sense of shame and, moreover, set themselves right.
             <footer>Confucius (2:3)</footer>
            </blockquote>

             <p class="lead">Western philosophers have a widespread of views regarding levels of government involvement and power. For example, Adam Smith's liberalism claims the government's purpose to defence, public works, and administration of finance and justice. This is in direct contrast with the Confucian perspective. According to Confucianism, the government has a major responsibility in the moral education of its citizens. With regards to computer ethics, the Confucian view implies the following: the government must be actively involved in any computer policy issue that might harm the citizens' ability to live a moral and harmonious life.</p>
             <br>

             <h3 class="purple">CYBER-WARFARE AND ARMS CONTROL</h3>
             <p class="lead">One of the major computing issues is related to cyber-warfare and arms control. Many ethical issues arise with warfare. For example, when is war justifiable? To what extent should war involve the use of violence? We will examine the Confucian view with regards to war and violence, and apply that philosophy to government policies on cyber-warfare and arms control.</p>

             <p class="lead"> Confucius believed that violence should not have a role in the ideal society. Since Confucius placed great emphasis on social harmony and rituals, he deemed war acceptable only if it serves the purpose of restoring ritual order. If we follow this perspective, we can claim that Confucius will reject wars that advance state interests. For example, Confucian ethics will reject cyberwarfare declared to advance national economic interests of hacking a enemy's country database to destablize the economy. If the state's goal in war is not caused by the desire to increase harmonious social order, war is not justified.</p>

             <p class="lead">Confucian policies on arms-control follows from his perspective on both violence and the government's role. According to Confucius, the state acts as the moral guardian of the people. As such, an interpretation of Confucian ethics could argue that the government should not freely distribute arms to all its citizens for two key reasons. Firstly, distributing arms might send the message that violence is acceptable in the state, meaning that the state has failed to uphold the standard of harmony. Second, though arms might be necessary in some cases (such as to restore social harmony in the case of extreme moral impropriety), it should only be used in very specific cases. This view is expressed in one of Confucian text, in a dialogue between Tzu-kung and Confucius. Asked to abandon either food, armament, and the confidence of the people, Confucius would abandon armament first.</p>

             <blockquote>
             Tzu-kung asked about government. Confucius said, "Sufficient food, sufficient armament, and sufficient confidence of the people." Tzukung said, "Forced to give up one of these, which would you abandon first? Confucius said, "I would abandon the armament." Tzu-kung said, "Forced to give up one of the remaining two, which would you abandon first?" Confucius said, "I would abandon food. There have been deaths from time immemorial, but no state can exist without the confidence of the people."

             <h3 class="purple">CYBER INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</h3>
             <p class="lead">Introduce the issue of cyber-international relations</p>

             <p class="lead">Confucius, on this issue, will state that maintenance of harmonious social order are initiated by Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven refers to the highest rulers who are appointed by the heavens/Gods to maintain social harmony between heaven and earth. Since government is currently the highest rulers of the state, harmonious social order in the international world must then be maintained by higher order, some form of international government.</p>

             <p class="lead">Currently, one can argue that the United Nations (an international body) could be considered the highest governing body, the 'Sons of Heaven' whose duties are to maintain social harmony on Earth. A Confucian perspective on cyber international relations might advocate for policies where international bodies, such as the United Nations, have more power and control over cyber-international issues including but not limited to cyberwarfare, internation intellectual property, legal computing laws. Furthermore, these international leaders governing the cyber international relations must rule according to Confucian principles of order, relational propriety, and peace.</p>

             <p class="lead">Western. Realism: state's interest supersede moral principle, with some cooperation at international level. Or maybe utilitairins,? most state?Implications, current policy and policy proposal.</p>

             <br>

             <h3 class="purple">SURVEILLANCE + BIG DATA</h3>
             <p class="lead">As mentioned previously, the Confucian state emphasizes civility and social consensus. As such, a Confucian government must advocate for open discussion of public questions. However, an open discussion must not result in complete freedom of expression in all matters. Rather, what is more important than complete freedom of expression is the upholding of state's moral standards. If necessary, government should ban any forms of moral impropreity and any methods of expression that result in moral corruption of its citizens.</p>

             <p class="lead">With regards to the issue of surveillance and big data, Confucianists advocated an open discussion of public questions. However, because of the Confucian view of moral fabric underlying society, Confucianists do not intend this open discussion to have complete freedom of expression. On the other hand, any tendencies of immorality or potential for moral corruption of society could be banned, so the moral fabric remains. For example, confucianist will agree on the banning of pornography for children, justifying surveillance of internet usage. </p>

             <p class="lead">Big data allows government to mine the data for the good of the society. As previously discussed, Confucianism believed in the importance of stable political order and proper moral basis. The government must create a state that allows “moral cultivation at all levels of the society”. With regards to big data, the government can then use the data as a tool and means to cultivate such a moral standard. Data mining, for example, could possibly be allowed if it serves the purpose of proper flourishing of social relations. Citizens must learn to understand on how they should behave and act within the cyberspace. The government, must then, enforce such standards to allow the citizens to enforce the moral standards of the state..</p>

            <h3 class="purple">SECTION TITLE</h3>
            <p class="lead">The ubiquity of technology has given rise to many ethical questions of its use.  Because cyberspace is both vast and invisible, people can easily manipulate an otherwise positive resource for it’s unethical purposes.  The economic implications of managing such a system and implicating those who break their social contracts can be difficult to define, therefore.  New structures require new rules, and technology makes it tough to delineate the line between right and wrong just by its nature.  While Confucianism preaches virtue ethics, that is leading one’s life based on doing “unto others as you would be done by” (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), the internet currently lacks this proverb as users do not necessarily discern ethical and unethical content online.  Thus, it is important to put a price on the repercussions of unethical uses of technology, especially if computers are being used for more harm than good in the world. </p>

            <p class="lead">The list of “computer-engendered problems” is long, according to MIT’s Tom Forester and Perry Morrison: “health risks, invasions of privacy, confusions over ownership and authorship, alterations of workplace mores, crimes, uncertainties of liability, and crises in national defense” (Forester & Morrison, p. 299).  The authors use examples of computer theft and hacker breaks to show that they can be just as harmful as destroying personal goods.  California congressman Ed Zschau is quoted after thieves broke into his office and destroyed his computer system, “Because people don’t see the files overturned or a pile of ashes outside the door, it doesn’t seem as bad…But it is equally devastating” (New York Times).  Fundamentally, the law does not recognize online break-ins the same ways it does physical break-ins.  “The analogies are weak, doctrines are lacking, and new conceptualizations have not kept pace with technological development” (Forester & Morrison, 302).  Yet, when we consider the costs of computer-related security briefs, it is clear our online presence may be more expensive than our physical one.  For example, the infamous “Love Bug” virus took more victims than a common cold, claiming about 45 million computers worldwide, according to research firm Computer Economics (attrition.org).  Overall, the damage cost society between $7 and $10 billion.  On a per computer basis, each infected computer causes $222 in damages ($10 billion in damages divided by 45 million computers) (attrition.org).  What’s more is that the Love Bug virus abused a very small feature in the Windows system, their Scripting Host.  Oftentimes, the overlooked aspects of technology are the deadliest parts.  If a few lines of code can cause this much economic loss, abused technology and it’s unethical users pose a great concern to society. </p>

            <p class="lead">Mcafee Security produced a report in June 2014, “Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime,” in which they cited an estimated $400 million of annual costs to the global economy from cybercrime and a conservative $375 billion in losses, up to $575 billion.  “Even the smallest of these figures is more than the national income of most countries and governments,” so it is imperative we take this issue extremely seriously as a global economic leader.  The report’s conclusion is that governments need to make a systematic effort in publishing cybercrime data to “make better choices about risk and policy”  (Mcafee).  Not only is cybercrime considered a “tax on innovation,” but it also reduces returns to these companies, investors, and shareholders.  Instances of technology abuse could, therefore, cost as many as 200,000 American jobs and increase U.S.’s unemployment rate, a bout to our economy we cannot afford.  As the report implores, people need to make better decisions on how they use the resources at their disposal.  If we consider Confucian teachings then the best way to combat computer ethics issues is to self-cultivate, or give users the tools they need to determine right versus wrong.  We must find a way to empower individuals without suppressing the freedom of speech that technology so positively allows. </p>

            <p class="lead">Forester and Morrison’s solution is to create a technology system that would essentially combat computer ethics problems.  The software would host a database of all technology related misdemeanor cases and their respective sentences.  When a criminal is being convicted, the system “automatically matches his case to the nearest analogous case in the database, and imposes the mean sentence calculated from it’s conscience” (p. 303).  We would standardize the legal process and the right to a jury of human beings.  Although creating such software would take extensive initial capital, especially in research & development costs, it would likely save money in the long run with legal and labor costs.  This solution, although economically sound, would pose additional ethical problems, as it is a computer itself.  When society begins to delegate humanizing activities to non-human systems, we are eliminating the most basic human instinct: consciousness.  Confucianism praises the individual’s way of life, not the rules that restrict and govern the individual; therefore, the only viable solution to ethical dilemmas would be one that teaches and empowers the user, rather than limits him.</p>

            <p class="lead">It is difficult to resolve issues of ethics in relation to technology and ethics we impose on society.  Innovation calls for creative solutions to online ethical problems.  Terry Winograd, Professor Emirates of Stanford’s Computer Science program believes that we should “integrate computer technology and human values in such a way that the technology advances and protects those values rather than doing damage to them” (Fordham).  In keeping with Confucian standards, Winograd’s comment looks to merge our instinctual human characteristics with the forces of technology that control our lives today.  If we find a cost effective way to combat unethical issues online by enabling the user, rather than preventing him from using resources in the way they were meant to, we would be doing a service to society. </p>
